# Muon Detector Simulation
`original-submission`

This repo holds the code and thesis for my MSci Natural Sciences master's project **Understanding Cosmic Muons Through Simulation**. 
The project aimed to produce an object-oriented Monte Carlo simulation of a cosmic muon detector setup commonly used in schools/universities, which could be
used to better understand the limitations of the setup. The project ran for the 2021/22 academic year (Sep '21 - Jul '22).

This `original-submission` branch contains the state of the project as submitted in March 2022. The files present in this branch are:
- [`muon-sim.ipynb`](muon-sim.ipynb) - The original code. 
- [`thesis.pdf`](thesis.pdf) - The thesis text.
- [`lit-review.pdf`](lit-review.pdf) - The literature survey and outline, submitted in the first month of the project
- [`BSc-lit-review.pdf`](BSc-lit-review.pdf) - My 3rd year/BSc thesis (a literature review on the field of muon tomography), which partially inspired this project.

Further development of this project since submission can be found on the `dev` branch.
