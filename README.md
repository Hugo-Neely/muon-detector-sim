# Muon Detector Simulation
This repo holds the code and thesis for my MSci Natural Sciences master's project **Understanding Cosmic Muons Through Simulation**. 
The project aimed to produce an object-oriented Monte Carlo simulation of a cosmic muon detector setup commonly used in schools/universities, which could be
used to better understand the limitations of the setup. The project ran for the 2021/22 academic year (Sep '21 - Jul '22).

The original code is presented in [`muon-sim.ipynb`](muon-sim.ipynb). The submitted thesis text is available in [`thesis.pdf`](thesis.pdf), 
and the associated literature survey and outline submitted in the first month of the projectis presented in [`lit-review.pdf`](lit-review.pdf).

There are no plans to further develop this project, though I may come back to it at some point if inspiration strikes!
